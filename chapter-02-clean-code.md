# Notes - Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
## What I learned
It is really important to find good names for everything. There are some rules about the naming.
<br>
### 1. Intention-Revealing Names (no comments necessary)
Example for 1.)
<pre>
int d; // elapsed time in days 

int elapsedTimeInDays; 
</pre>
Choosing names that clearly reveal intent makes code easier to read, understand, and modify. The purpose of intention-revealing names is to make your code more explicit, enabling others (and your future self) to grasp its meaning quickly and with minimal effort.
