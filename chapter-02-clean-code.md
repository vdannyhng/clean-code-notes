# Notes - Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
## What I learned
It is really important to find good names for everything. There are some rules about the naming.
<br>
### 1. Intention-Revealing Names (no comments necessary)
Example for 1.)
<pre>
int d; // elapsed time in days 

int elapsedTimeInDays; 
</pre>
Choosing names that clearly reveal intent makes code easier to read, understand, and modify. The purpose of intention-revealing names is to make your code more explicit, enabling others (and your future self) to grasp its meaning quickly and with minimal effort.

Important rules for naming:
- Intention-revealing names
- Avoid Disinformation 
- Make meaningful distinctions
- Use pronounceable names
- Use searchable names
- Avoid encodings
- Hungarian notation (not common anymore)
- Member prefixes (not common anymore)
- Interfaces and implementations
- Avoid mental mapping
- Class names (noun)
- Method names (verb)
- Don't be cute
- Pick one word per concept
- Don't pun
- Use solution domain names
- Use problem domain names
- Add meaningful context (addrState)
- Don't add gratuitious context
