# Notes - Chapter 1: Clean Code
## What I learned
Requirements should be as formal as the code because those can act as executable tests of the code. Bad code can ruin your whole company. You can refer bad code as wading through mud. It **slows down** your **efficiency** and make it **hard to fix bugs** and **plan releases**. Best quote for messy code: _"No change is trivial"_.
<br>
The redesign process is very cost intensive. New redesing process is racing the old shitty system. A good comparism is doctor (developer) and patient (manager).
Managers should not force deadlines that make code messy. Good and structured code is key of success. 
<br>
Improvement to make processes faster? Good and clean code. But what exactly is Clean Code?
<br>
<br>
**Stroustrup(C++ inventor):** Elegant, efficient, straightforward, not tempting to be messy
<br>
Important take: You cannot write code if you cannot read the surrounding code. If you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.
